## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the **FIT2101: Software Engineering Process and Management** unit at Monash University. The primary goal was to learn and apply the **Scrum framework**, work in a team environment, and build a functioning software product through three development sprints.

The scenario: Our fictional start-up received an investment to develop a lightweight, cost-effective project management tool to support Agile development without relying on expensive third-party tools.
